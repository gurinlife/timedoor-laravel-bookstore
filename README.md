## Build

PHP 7.4

Laravel 8.8

## Instalation

1. Create database "timedoor_bookstore" for migrating or you can run SQL file in public folder.

2. Configure .env for database configuration (depend on your environment).

3. Run "composer install" in terminal laravel folder to install Laravel requirement for running.

4. Run "php artisan migrate --seed" for running migration, factory and seed.

5. In my case I use laragon for windows to configure the host, you can use anything for hosting laravel.
